        Anyone who's ever taken the metro in Washington D.C. probably knows how frustrating and inconvenient it can be. Thus, I've created an app for people to vent their DC metro frustrations. This website was built in Rails in about a week. I used mediaqueries to make the site responsive.
        <div class="break">
        When users come to this site they can log in and post a complaint about the metro. When a user posts a complaint about the DC metro system, he or she needs to select the color of the metro-line that that specific event occurred on. The color that he/she picks will become the border color of that post. This way, people who visit the site can easily tell which metro line has the most issues because there will be more posts with that metro-line color. Users can also comment on other people's post and delete or edit their own posts.

        I made this JavaScript memory game to showcase my artwork (all of the images on the cards were painted by me). I learned so much about JavaScript through the making of this game. Making this game also made me realize that I want to continue to work with JavaScript in the future.

        Cryptly is a URL shortener for the recently deceased because ghosts need to shorten URLs too! This was a group project made in one day. I was in charge of the design and CSS of the website. I used media queries to make the page mobile friendly as you can see in the demonstration above. I then connected my design to the backend code made in Express by my group members. We used GitHub for version control.
